This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br>
This project makes use of data from the [Rijksmuseum API](http://rijksmuseum.github.io/).
<br>

NOTE: An api-key is required to be able to access the Rijksmuseum data. For info on how to obtain one instantly go to: https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/api . Once you've obtained the API key, create a new '.env' file in the root folder and add the following variable REACT_APP_API_KEY = "[insert api key here]" . This should allow the paintings to be desplayed.

### HOW TO RUN
-git clone<br>
-npm install<br>
-npm run start<br>
The app is now running on localhost:3000
